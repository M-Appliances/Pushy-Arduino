# Pushy

**_Note this branch is still under development_**

This repo contains the code and resources for Pushy, a Maker Appliances device.

Pushy is the ESP32 variant of our popular self build 'PushThru' [found here] (https://github.com/Maker-Appliances/PushThru/). Where our PushThru board uses standard thru hole components, the Pushy is a complete and assembled board making use of SMD components.

So... If you dont have the time to make a device, but want to play around with our code (and help us make it better) Pushy is the board for you!

Check out the guides and find out what we do at [Maker Appliances](https://makerappliances.com)!
