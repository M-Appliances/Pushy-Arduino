# Pushy

**_Note this branch is still under development_**

This repo contains the code and resources for Pushy, a Maker Appliances device.

Pushy is the ESP32 variant of our popular self build 'PushThru' [found here] (https://github.com/Maker-Appliances/PushThru/). Where our PushThru board uses standard thru hole components, the Pushy is a complete and assembled board making use of SMD components.

So... If you dont have the time to make a device, but want to play around with our code (and help us make it better) Pushy is the board for you!
